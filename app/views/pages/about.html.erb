  Hello, there.
</p>

<p>
  This is a very simple site with the purpose of remembering links to places
  you visit on a regular basis. You can enter a site and which days of the week
  you want to check it. Every day, you can come back here and see a list of all
  your sites for today.
</p>

<p>
  For some possibly asked questions (PAQ), take a look
  <%= link_to 'here', paq_page_path %>.
</p>

<p>
  If you'd like to try it out, just sign in below and you can destroy your
  account whenever you like.

<%= link_to 'Sign in with twitter', '/auth/twitter' %>
